	 make MINGW=1
	   creates a windows 32 bit findent.exe

	   ticket 1: 
	      more precise recognition of function statement

	findent.y: 
	   recognize ' x = 3 & ! comment' as a line needing a continuation
	   preprocessor statements are handled on ad-hoc basis

findent-1.5.3
	findent.y:
	   add fixed-to-free: add check if this is a preprocessor line
	   fixed-to-free: fixed fortran can have a trailing comment,
	      starting with !, and have a continuation line.
	      This is fixed.
	   fixed-to-free: fixed bad handling of otherwise empty continuation lines
	findent.l: 
	   better recognition of fixed and free
	   recognize 'integer(kind=8) function func1(a,b)' as a function
	           Thanks to Dusan Jovic
